jNDN v0.4 (2015-03-09)
----------------------

Changes
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2532#change-8836 In Face.registerPrefix, if connected to a remote
  NFD then use localhop to do remote registration. (For remote registration, the remote NFD must be configured
  for localhop_security.) Added the optional method Face.isLocal() for the application to check if the
  connection is local. Thanks again to Andrew Brown!
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2531 Handle an incoming NFD LocalControlHeader
  packet and return it in the packet getIncomingFaceId().
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2545 In Blob and Name, added hashCode().
* Added class util/SegmentFetcher, ported from ndn-cxx. Use it in examples TestListRib, etc.
* In MemoryIdentityStorage, implemented support to get/set the default identity/key, etc. Thanks to Andrew Brown.
* Examples: Added TestListFaces to query NFD the same as "nfd-status -f".
* Examples: Added TestListChannels to query NFD the same as "nfd-status -c".
* Unit tests: In TestNameComponents, etc. added testHashCode().
* Integration tests: Added TestLocalControlHeader.

Bug fixes
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2619: Data.setName, etc. should copy the object.
* Blob: Fix bug for getImmutableArray() when the ByteBuffer is read only.

* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2388 Moved example programs from "tests" to "examples".
* In KeyChain.createIdentity, added an optional KeyParams argument.
* Examples: Added TestListRib to query NFD the same as "nfd-status -r".
* Unit tests: Added test-der-encode-decode tests for CertificateExtension.
* Unit tests: Moved unit tests that depend on the file system to integration-tests.

* In the default WireFormat, implemented decodeControlParameters. Thanks again to Andrew Brown!
* Unit tests: Added TestFilePrivateKeyStorage. Thanks to Andrew Brown!
