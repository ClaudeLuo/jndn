jndn:  A Named Data Networking client library for Java
------------------------------------------------------

jndn is a new implementation of a Named Data Networking client library written in Java.
It is wire format compatible with the new NDN-TLV encoding, with NDNx and PARC's CCNx.

NDN-CPP conforms to the NDN Common Client Libraries API and your application should
follow this public API:
http://named-data.net/doc/ndn-ccl-api/ .

See the file [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/named-data/jndn/blob/master/INSTALL.md) for build and install instructions.

Please submit any bugs or issues to the NDN-CPP issue tracker:
http://redmine.named-data.net/projects/jndn/issues

---

The library currently requires a remote NDN daemon, and has been tested with:
* ndnd from NDNx: https://github.com/named-data/ndnx
* ndnd-tlv (which uses NDNx): https://github.com/named-data/ndnd-tlv
* The new NFD forwarder: https://github.com/named-data/NFD
